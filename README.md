2. Introduction
  Source of Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer
  In our analysis we will observe trends between different player attributes and see if there is any correlation.  

3. Data Curation
In this step, we collect data. We got our database from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer. It offers information from over 25000 matches from 2008 to 2016. It also contains information about team and player attributes from FIFA, a sports game by Electronic Arts(EA).
